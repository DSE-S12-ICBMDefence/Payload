Pixelsize: calculation of required pixelsize for ICBM detection
using the filters and method discussed in the reports.

CircularScanning: program to find largest pixel within given 
FOV and camera resolution for given altitude. Together with the
value obtained from Pixelsize this program is used to find 
the parameters for the FOV etc for the scanning method used.

Probability programs: used to find the required failure 
probability of single S/C within the 7 year lifetime to
ensure a mission succes rate of 99%. Program assumes the 
circular scanning technique that has double coverage
allowing for more failure and therefore has an increased 
reliability.
